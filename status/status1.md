# 1. Recap

=======

The three weeks plan was for each of us to get fully setup in our repo with a working Unity project. Rather than working directly out of the repo we decided each to prototype within separate Unity projects so no settings or testing messed with our repo. Edwards plan was to learn model/asset creation, and learn to utlizie the method we found for cutting up our assets. Jacob was to work on Nav mesh along with getting agents to work with it. Additionally to see if he can integrate VR haptic gloves, and get the 3D AI model working. Ian was to work on the building destruction, and setup the VR rig.

## Description of Tasks Completed

Jacob setup Unity teams and found a 3D printer for making the VR gloves while aquiring various unity assets that can potentially be used in the project. Edward learned the necessary technique for cutting up any model that gets imported into blender for the destruction aspect of the game. Ian setup the Open XR rig with walking and turning, created a destruction wall script using our modified imported models, setup dynamic punching script for punch power, and started the leap functionality.

## Quantifiable Metrics

Each person met once each week for a few hours while maintaning continuous communication through discord group.

Ian wrote roughly 250 lines of code and spending roughly 30+ hours total.

# Successes

## Accomplishments

A. Able to get a variation of the destructable walls concept. Able to get physics implemented with VR Rig, along with proper movement/leaping. Created a dynamic punching script that guages how hard the user punches. Found and exercised a effecient way to cut up any assets acquired or made. 3D printer reserved for haptic gloves.

## Successful Solution

Creating destructable objects utilizing Unities configurable joints, dynamically, along with making the setup with the click of a button. Integrating Open XR movement components with Unity physics system on the player rig. Applying forces to object punched based off a users punching velocity. Blender asset cutting workflow.

## Things Tried But Didn't Work

For destructable buildings, the configurable joints route didnt seem like the best options since it held the wall chunks together too strongly, but this variation can still be used with any other destructable objects. Tried to install DreamFusion (AI model creator) on CentOS unsucessfully.
